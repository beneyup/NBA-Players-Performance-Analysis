# [Project 1: NBA Players' Performance Analysis](https://github.com/beneyup/Python-Portfolio-Projects/tree/master-branch)

In this project, we're going to analyze how NBA players performed over years
by;
* Creating season and player dictionaries to cast our analysis through the years and the players.
* Using NumPy package to create arrays and matrixes.
* Performing mathematical operations on array elements.
* Using the matplotlib library and our own created function to generate the final plot to help us analyze the data.

# [Project 2: Gross Profit Analysis of Movies](https://github.com/beneyup/Python-Portfolio-Projects/tree/master-branch1)

In this project, we will analyse the specific genre types and the publisher studios that we picked from the data set by;
* Reading the CSV file.
* Changing the columns' types of variables if needed.
* Filtering the data.
* Creating a boxplot by using the seaborn library.
