# [Project 1: NBA Players' Performance Analysis](https://github.com/beneyup/Python-Portfolio-Projects/tree/master-branch)

In this project, we're going to analyze how NBA players performed over years
by;
* Creating season and player dictionaries to cast our analysis through the years and the players
* Using NumPy package to create arrays and matrixes.
* Performing mathematical operations on array elements
* Using the matplotlib library and our own created function to generate the final plot to help us analyze the data
